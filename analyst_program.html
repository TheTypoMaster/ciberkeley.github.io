      <h1>We invest in our members</h1>
        Analysts follow a specially designed, semester-long syllabus. Over the course of our education program analysts have the opportunity to learn about myriad investment strategies, fundamental analysis, and financial modeling, enabling them to explore various career paths. In addition to the analyst education program, analysts are also assigned to a client based project each semester, providing them practical experience in professional presentations, portfolio management, and investment research. By the end of the semester analysts will be well equipped to participate in the financial markets in both a professional and personal setting.
